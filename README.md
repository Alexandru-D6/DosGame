### Dos Game

This side project was developed to test and learn about making multiplayer games using [Prothon PUN 2](https://doc.photonengine.com/pun/current/getting-started/pun-intro). The game is a clone of [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)), allowing up to 4 player at the same lobby. Even though the game's mechanics are not complicated, I was able to learn how to handle the communication and syncronization across multiple players.

This clone includes the following features:
 - Easy lobby creation/selection
 - All the basics mechanism of the original game (+2, +4, color change, etc...)[not strictly following the official rules]
 - The first person to run out of cards wins

All the source code is available in the [Root](./) folder, and you can easily import it to unity using the version 6000.0.37f1. Newer version should also work, but they have not been tested.
